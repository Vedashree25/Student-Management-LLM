# Student-Management-LLM
This project is focused on developing a Student Management System integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent to handle book-related inquiries and student questions. The system is built with a backend LLM agent and a frontend using either Streamlit or FastAPI.

## Features

- Instruction-based agent for responding to book or topic-related questions.
- Suggests or recommends books, papers, and articles based on the student's query.
- Follows up on questions for continued interaction.
- Proper code structure with separation across supervisor, adapter, and LLM layers.
- Logs user interactions for history tracking.
